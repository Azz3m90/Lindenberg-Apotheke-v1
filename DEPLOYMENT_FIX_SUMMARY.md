# Deployment Fix Summary - Emergency Pharmacy API

## Problem Identified

The emergency pharmacy service was not working on the Netlify deployment because:

1. **Wrong API Path**: The app was calling `/api` instead of `/.netlify/functions/api` on production
2. **Date Range**: Confirmed working correctly (13th current month to 27th next month)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Centralized Configuration (`src/utils/config.ts`)

Created a centralized configuration file that:

- Automatically detects environment (production vs development)
- Returns correct API endpoint based on environment
- Manages all configuration values in one place

```typescript
// Production detection - any domain that's not localhost
const isProduction =
  !hostname.includes("localhost") && !hostname.includes("127.0.0.1");

// API endpoint selection
export function getApiEndpoint(): string {
  return isProduction() ? "/.netlify/functions/api" : "/api";
}
```

### 2. Updated EmergencyPharmacyService Component

- Now uses centralized configuration
- Automatically switches between development and production endpoints
- Consistent retry logic using config values

### 3. Session Storage Implementation âœ…

- Cache stored in `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`)
- **Automatically clears when browser is closed**
- Prevents stale data across browser sessions

### 4. Retry Logic (3 Attempts) âœ…

- Makes up to 3 API attempts before showing error
- 2-second delay between retries
- Clear progress indicators for each attempt

### 5. No Data Duplication âœ…

- Clears existing data before loading new data
- Clears cache before saving fresh data
- Ensures only current data is displayed

## Environment Detection

The system now uses a simple and reliable detection method:

| Environment | Hostname               | API Endpoint              |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Development | localhost or 127.0.0.1 | `/api`                    |
| Production  | Any other domain       | `/.netlify/functions/api` |

## Testing the Fix

### On Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/notdienst
# Should use /api endpoint
```

### On Netlify Deployment

```bash
# After deployment
# Visit https://lindenberg-apotheke-v1.netlify.app/notdienst
# Should use /.netlify/functions/api endpoint
```

### Direct API Test on Netlify

```bash
curl "https://lindenberg-apotheke-v1.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api?begin=2025-08-13&end=2025-09-27&token=0075e630f7ea1c1900a8bb186ccc7382b0f48608"
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/config.ts`** (NEW)

   - Centralized configuration
   - Environment detection
   - API endpoint selection

2. **`src/components/EmergencyPharmacyService.tsx`**

   - Uses centralized config
   - Improved retry logic
   - Better environment detection

3. **`src/utils/cacheUtils.ts`**

   - Changed to sessionStorage
   - Auto-clears on browser close

4. **`netlify/functions/api.js`**
   - Existing Netlify function (unchanged)
   - Proxies requests to LAKT API

## Key Features

### âœ… Automatic Environment Detection

- No manual configuration needed
- Works on any domain
- Automatically uses correct API endpoint

### âœ… Session-Based Caching

- Data cached only for current browser session
- Clears when browser closes
- Fresh data on each browser session

### âœ… Robust Error Handling

- 3 retry attempts
- Clear error messages in German
- Contact information provided

### âœ… No Data Duplication

- Clean data management
- Old data cleared before new data
- Consistent display

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [x] Environment detection working
- [x] Session storage implemented
- [x] Retry logic with 3 attempts
- [x] No data duplication
- [x] Netlify function exists at `netlify/functions/api.js`
- [x] Configuration centralized

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Netlify**: Push changes to trigger auto-deployment
2. **Verify Function**: Check Netlify Functions tab to ensure `api` function is deployed
3. **Test Production**: Visit the `/notdienst` page on production site
4. **Monitor**: Check Netlify Function logs for any issues

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for the API endpoint being called
   - Should see: `ðŸ“¡ API attempt 1/3 to /.netlify/functions/api...`
2. **Verify Netlify Function**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard > Functions
   - Ensure `api` function is listed and active
3. **Test Direct API Call**:
   - Use the curl command above to test the Netlify function directly
4. **Check Date Range**:
   - Console should show: `13th current month to 27th next month`

## Summary

The deployment is now configured to:

- âœ… Automatically detect environment
- âœ… Use correct API endpoint (Netlify Functions in production)
- âœ… Make 3 retry attempts
- âœ… Clear cache when browser closes
- âœ… Prevent data duplication
- âœ… Show clear error messages

The system is ready for deployment and should work correctly on Netlify.
